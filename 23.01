{
color - means text color

}

If you declare same things, the farther down declaration wins

. - is class selector

select specific item within a class.
.class selector
example
.body-text p{
}

flex item  - everything inside flexbox. 


selectors: 
id = #
class = .

You can give multiple classes in one class declaration  = class="center large"> -> this means this has 2 slasses, center and large
* - selects all elements on a page
So, an inline element with display: block; is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.

to make width property easier to manupilate its better to add 
html{
  box-sizing:border-box;}
  
in flex justify-content is responsibler for distributing extra space between flex items
